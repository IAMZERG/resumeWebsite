				<h1 class="page-header">Hello, my name is Wes.</h1>  
				<p>I'm a pretty dull person.  Black and white are among my favorite colors, as you might guess...
				I am well-educated.  I have Bachelor of Science in Biology. I began my education in Computer Engineering
				and Computer Science, but took some time off, changed my mind, and became a biology major over a year into the program.</p>
				<hr>
				<h3>What makes Wes tick?</h3>
				<p>My experience in programming came both from high school and from college.  Unfortunately, from that experience,
				I was led to believe that a career in programming would necessarily be a boring one.  Code Louisville and their use of the Treehouse curriculum has proven my notions wrong.
				Learning to write HTML, use CSS, and write JavaScript has been an enjoyable, pain-free experience so far.  Creating webpages using these elements seems a lot less daunting than
				I thought it would be.
				</p>
				<p>I haven't been at this very long, but my skills have grown quite a bit since I first started.
				</p>
				<p>Go on a brief journey with me to see who I am and how I have changed.
				</p>
